Have docker, and Nextflow installed\n1. `nextflow run main.nf`\n\n### Some thoughts on reference building\n\n- We could use the glob and if you just drop a fasta in s3 bucket it'll get picked up and new resources built\n  - Could take this a step further and make it a little config file that has the fasta, gtf, genome_size etc.\n- How do we avoid rebuilding? Ideally we should build once on a new minor release of an aligner/reference. IMO kinda low priority because the main cost is going to be egress, not compute.\n- How much effort is too much effort?\n  - Should it be as easy as adding a file on s3?\n    - No that shouldn't be a requirement, should be able to link to a reference externally (A \"source of truth\" ie an FTP link), and the workflow will build the references\n    - So like mulled biocontainers, just make a PR to the samplesheet and boom new reference in the s3 bucket if it's approved?\n\n### Roadmap\n\nPoC for v1.0:\n\n- Replace aws-igenomes\n  - bwa, bowtie2, star, bismark need to be built\n  - fasta, gtf, bed12, mito_name, macs_gsize, blacklist, copied over\n\nOther nice things to have:\n\n- Building our test-datasets\n- Down-sampling for a unified genomics test dataset creation, (Thinking about viralitegration/rnaseq/wgs) and spiking in test cases of interest (Specific variants for example)\n\n## Citations\n\nIf you use nf-core/references for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.14576225](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14576225)\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add bibliography of tools and data used in your pipeline -->\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.\n\nYou can cite the `nf-core` publication as follows:\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n>\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n>\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n",
